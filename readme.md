## CS:GO Skin Tester Extension

This Google Chrome extension allows you to test any CS:GO skin in-game on a CS:GO community server.
You can equip the skin, walk around with it, and inspect it in the actual game environment.

## How does it work?

The Steam Community Market and most third party websites which deal with CS:GO skins have an "Inspect Link" that you can use to for the traditional in-game inspection of a skin.

This extension takes such an inspect link and sends it to a CS:GO community server which you can join, and where you're then equipped with the skin from the inspect link.

## Usage

Simply visit the Steam Community Market or any other third party website that supports inspect links for CS:GO skins, right-click on the inspect link, and click on "Test CS:GO skin in-game". You'll be connected to the CS:GO test server where you receive the skin.

Here are some popular skin platforms that support inspect links and where this extension will work:

- steamcommunity.com
- cs.money
- bitskins.com
- skinport.com
- skinbaron.com
- swap.gg
- And many others!
